Hello, world!

I'm a researcher at the Center for the Study of Science in Muslim Societies at Hampshire College, Amherst, Mass.  I've been here for a year and a half now, and love my work and the College.  But I really need to learn more about how various kinds of coding work, and environments to get them to work in.
